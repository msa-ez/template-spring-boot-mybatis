### Here are the advantages of using Spring Boot with MyBatis:

#### Simplified Configuration: Spring Boot provides auto-configuration capabilities, which reduces a lot of boilerplate setup. Integrating MyBatis with Spring Boot is straightforward with minimal configuration.

#### Flexible SQL Mapping: Unlike other ORM tools, MyBatis allows developers to write their SQL queries, providing more flexibility and control over database interactions.

#### Performance: MyBatis can be more efficient than some other ORM solutions since it doesn't add much overhead. You can optimize your SQL queries directly.

#### Integrated Transactions: Spring Boot provides seamless transaction management, and when combined with MyBatis, it ensures that database operations are managed correctly and efficiently.

#### Type Handlers: MyBatis allows custom type handlers, enabling mapping between Java objects and SQL types in a highly customizable manner.

#### Dynamic SQL: With MyBatis, you can easily build dynamic SQL statements based on conditions, which can be a powerful tool for building flexible applications.

#### Database Agnostic: While you're writing raw SQL with MyBatis, you can still make your application relatively database agnostic using its features and by being careful with your SQL.

#### Ecosystem Compatibility: Spring Boot has a vast ecosystem, and MyBatis fits right in. You can easily integrate it with other Spring projects or modules.

#### Clear Separation of Concerns: By using MyBatis, SQL statements can be kept separately from Java code, ensuring a cleaner separation of concerns.

#### Development Speed: With the Spring Boot starter for MyBatis, setting up and developing applications can be fast, leveraging Spring Boot's rapid development capabilities with the flexibility of MyBatis.

#### Active Community: Both Spring Boot and MyBatis have active communities. This ensures that you'll have good support, regular updates, and a wealth of shared knowledge from other developers.
